## Key Insights
- Revenue demonstrates consistent growth from 2014 to 2017, with moderate monthly variability and mild year-end seasonal spikes.
- The Consumer segment is the primary revenue driver, significantly outperforming Corporate and Home Office segments.
- The top 10 customers contribute only 6.7% of total revenue, indicating a diversified revenue base with low dependency risk.
- Technology is the highest-performing product category by revenue.

## Business Recommendation
The company should prioritize growth strategies within the Consumer segment while strengthening engagement in Corporate and Home Office segments. Increasing average order value through bundled offerings and targeted promotions may further accelerate revenue growth.
